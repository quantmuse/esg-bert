# esg-bert

In this notebook, we used the pre-trained ESG-BERT model to classify text of sustainability reports for these three companies: McDonaldâ€™s, Amazon and Newmont Mining.

We will use a Python library called Tika to help us with parsing the documents into sentences, and then apply the ESG-BERT model via the Hugging Face transformers library.
